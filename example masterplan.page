# Exposition

We'll write some text describing the purpose of our plan here.

# Process Model

Next go to the [process modelling tool](/process-model/index.html).

Make a process model using the tool, and save it. You will now have created some process nodes in the wiki, which you can open and look at.

Now, inside the process modelling tool, search for your masterplan page and click on the 'embed' button when you find it.

You may also wish to include a link to the root process itself, in this case [Example/Process]().

[Process Example/Process](http://wiki.smartsteep.eu/process-model/index.html?wiki=http%253A%252F%252Fwiki.smartsteep.eu%252F&root=Example%252FProcess)

Note that each time you click embed you get the map again. If you do this you can just edit the page and delete the offending iframe.

# Map
Lastly, we'll [make a map](/open-data-map/index.html);

 1. Drag your data onto the map. 
 2. Select the areas you are interested in. 
 3. Click on table headers to sort and colour by a property. 
 4. Give your map a title.
 5. Click save.

Then search for your masterplan page and click the 'embed' button as before to add the map to your plan.
