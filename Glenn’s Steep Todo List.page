This is more or less in impact order. High up things have high priority / difficulty. Some things are at the end because they depend on Mediawiki move.

They need to be organised better.

# Bad unicode
The following unicode symbols don't work on Windows and need replacing:
 + Close handle for floating things
 + Resize handle for floating things
 + Delete layer

# Rename National Heat Map
English National Heat Map

# 'No Errors'
The errors/messages box should tell you when there aren't any errors or messages.

It should also show itself when you cause an error to happen.

# Move layer select to layer control
Remove layer-select.js and make certain layers in the layer control have on-click behaviour which focuses and zooms them.

# Hide the wiki url
It's always the same, so don't allow people to change it.

Move the save button over by the title bar by default.

Provide a link to get back to the wiki. Do we want to get to a particular page?

# Hide/show layers bug
After you uncheck a layer's check box to hide it, you can't show it again. Fix this.

# Back button behaviour
The map and process model both make history states as soon as they are loaded. This means you have to double-tab the back button to ever get out of them. Stop this.

# Icon alignment
Some of the icons in the map toolbar are a little too far to the left.

# Disable scroll zoom over iframe
It's annoying when you're scrolling through an iframe and then you accidentally zoom the process model or map instead.

# Layer control permanence
Put an icon for the layer control in the toolbar, and make it a thing that appears on click rather than on hover.

# Disable double-click zoom
It's annoying. No-one cares about mobile anyway.

# Adding a link to process model broken

# Store layout of process model
Put it in a modelname/layout

# Search 

## For pages
This currently searches in the text. It should also include page names. If possible, it shouldn't let you load the wrong kinds of things, but that might be harder.

Might be worth moving this after the Mediawiki port? Depends how easy it is.

## For maps or process models
Do this using semantic search

## For pages this map is embedded into

## For layers that go into this map
Add a + button to the layers control. This should offer the option to search the wiki for layers which have previously been used in any map.

# Port save/load to Mediawiki
We think the Semantic Mediawiki features are worth having, so we've decided to use that rather than Gitit as our final platform.

# Update embedded
If we're editing in an iframe, or maybe if we just came from a document which had this map or process model embedded in it, the save button should be replaced with an update embedded button.

The wiki should have a way to search for and embed maps.

Maybe also have a save copy button?

# Selection Save
This currently has too options: embedded selection or in a separate document. Pick only one so that it doesn't get confused.

# Export as document
Check if this exists in Mediawiki.

Come up with a way to export the iframes (render them and turn them into a picture).

# Colours
Each layer could have a colour picker box.

# Tables and Selection
Make a table per layer with a show/hide table button in the layers control.

Give each table a checkbox for show all / show selected.

Think about whether to disallow selection across multiple layers at the same time.

Put in a search/filter for selecting objects within a layer.

# Tooltips
Put these on all the icons
