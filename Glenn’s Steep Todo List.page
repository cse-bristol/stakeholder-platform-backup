This is more or less in impact order. High up things have high priority / difficulty. Some things are at the end because they depend on Mediawiki move.

They need to be organised better.

# Layer search
Add a + button to the layers control. This should offer the option to search the wiki for layers which have previously been used in any map.

# Bad unicode
The following unicode symbols don't work on Windows and need replacing:
 + Close handle for floating things
 + Resize handle for floating things
 + Delete layer

# Rename National Heat Map
English National Heat Map

# 'No Errors'
The errors/messages box should tell you when there aren't any errors or messages.

It should also show itself when you cause an error to happen.

# Move layer select to layer control
Remove layer-select.js and make certain layers in the layer control have on-click behaviour which focuses and zooms them.

# Hide/show layers bug
After you uncheck a layer's check box to hide it, you can't show it again. Fix this.

# Back button behaviour
The map and process model both make history states as soon as they are loaded. This means you have to double-tab the back button to ever get out of them. Stop this.

# Icon alignment
Some of the icons in the map toolbar are a little too far to the left.

# Disable scroll zoom over iframe
It's annoying when you're scrolling through an iframe and then you accidentally zoom the process model or map instead.

# Layer control permanence
Put an icon for the layer control in the toolbar, and make it a thing that appears on click rather than on hover.

# Disable double-click zoom
It's annoying. No-one cares about mobile anyway.

# Adding a link to process model broken

# Store layout of process model
Put it in a modelname/layout

# Search for pages
This currently searches in the text. It should also include page names. If possible, it shouldn't let you load the wrong kinds of things, but that might be harder.

Might be worth moving this after the Mediawiki port? Depends how easy it is.

# Port save/load to Mediawiki
We think the Semantic Mediawiki features are worth having, so we've decided to use that rather than Gitit as our final platform.

# Update embedded
If we're editing in an iframe, or maybe if we just came from a document which had this map or process model embedded in it, the save button should be replaced with an update embedded button.

# Export as document
Check if this exists in Mediawiki.

Come up with a way to export the iframes (render them and turn them into a picture).

# Tooltips
Put these on all the icons
