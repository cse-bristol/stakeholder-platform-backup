# Demonstrating the STEEP stakeholder engagement tool

## What is an Energy Plan?

An energy plan is a documented statement about the intended future development of some aspects of the energy system in a specific place, over a specific time. However, as we are discovering through the STEEP project, there are many possible interpretations of what constitutes a plan, and much complexity around the processes of creating and implementing any such plan. For example:

- different geographic scales relate to different technical concerns
- different timescales relate to different types of decision
- different regions and countries have different regulatory and technical, and data contexts
- different stakeholders in the process have different capacities, interests, and degrees of influence

Despite all this variation, through the STEEP project and our previous experience, we identified a few statements which could be made about any energy plan:

1. It is a document
2. It needs to make specific statements about the energy system in specific places at specific times
3. It needs to be able to relate to any geographic scale
4. It needs to be able describe complex processes
5. A range of different types of stakeholders may have an interest or role in its development

## What is the tool?

Given these statements, we have developed a prototype for an application which allows users to do create and collaboratively edit a document shared across multiple other editors (a wiki). However in addition to text, images, etc, the application allows people, using only a web browser, to 
- create, embed and share maps including user data, for any location and scale (a GIS)
- create, embed and share visualisations of complex processes (a Hierarchical Process Modelling tool)
- make links within their document, and to external resources





We have created a collaborative document editor which, in addition to text, images, videos and sound, allows the creation and inclusion of two special types of content which are considered useful in energy planning:

- process models
- maps

This editor is designed to be highly accessible - it is web based, and requires no specialist software on the part of the user. It is basically a wiki, but with the above special features. Here's how wikipedia defines a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki):

>A wiki is a web application which allows people to add, modify, or delete content in collaboration with others. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language (known as "wiki markup") or a rich-text editor... wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.

## Why have we made this tool?

CSE has designed and built this prototype as part of our contribution to the STEEP project. STEEP work package 2 envisages the development of a web-based GIS system for sharing energy masterplan related content. This platform meets that need, but goes further in some important ways, by allowing users to:

- upload and share map data with all other users
- build and share hierarchical process models with all other users
- link relate maps, process models, text, and external resource
- integrate all of the above in a collaboratively editable living document
