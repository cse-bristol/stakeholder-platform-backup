# Demonstrating the stakeholder engagement tool

## What is the tool?

A collaborative document editor which, in addition to text, images, videos and sound, allows the creation and inclusion of two special types of content which are considered useful in energy planning:

- process models
- maps

This editor is designed to be highly accessible - it is web based, and requires no specialist software on the part of the user. It is basically a wiki, but with the above special features. Here's how wikipedia defines a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki):

>A wiki is a web application which allows people to add, modify, or delete content in collaboration with others. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language (known as "wiki markup") or a rich-text editor... wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.
