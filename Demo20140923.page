# Demonstrating the STEEP stakeholder engagement tool

## What is an Energy Plan?

An energy plan is a documented statement about the intended future development of some aspects of the energy system in a specific place, over a specific time. However, as we are discovering through the STEEP project, there are many possible interpretations of what constitutes a plan, and much complexity around the processes of creating and implementing one. For example:

- different geographic scales relate to different technical concerns
- different timescales relate to different types of decision
- different regions and countries have different regulatory and technical, and data contexts
- different stakeholders in the process have different capacities, interests, and degrees of influence

Despite all this variation, through the STEEP project and our previous experience, we identified a few statements which could be made about any energy plan:

1. It is a document
2. It makes specific statements about the energy system in specific places at specific times
3. It could relate to any geographic scale
4. It may need to describe complex processes
5. A range of different types of stakeholders may have an interest or role in its development
6. This development may involve a lot of conversations between stakeholders

## What is the tool?

Based on this, we have developed a prototype for a flexible application which enables people, using only a web browser, to do create and collaboratively edit a publicly accessible document (a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)). However in addition to the usual wiki content of text, images, etc. the application also allows people, to:

- create, embed and share maps including user data, for any location and scale (a GIS), for example:

- create, embed and share visualisations of complex processes (a Hierarchical Process Modelling tool), for example:



- make links within their document, and to external resources, for example:

## Some further examples...

- WP 1.4 data harmonisation
- WP 2.1 process modelling
- WP 2.2 GIS infrastructure map

## Future plans
1. improve the user interface
2. enable export to PDF
3. add energy modelling features
    - solar PV and hot water
    - wind
    - district heating?

## How you use it

- starting a new document
- making a map
- embedding the map in the document
- making a process model
- embedding the process model in the document
